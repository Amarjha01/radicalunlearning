            We are parents and were students who have experienced the drawbacks
            of mainstream education: too much emphasis on learning measurement,
            flawed measurement techniques, carrot/stick approach, focus on
            memorization, limited exploration through questioning, intense
            pressure of competition & many moreâ€¦

          So, we have created a framework and platform for like-minded people mainly unschooling parents and homeschoolers in the learning community who would like to support our principles of open, enjoyable and effective learning. The framework offers essential principles of learning, tools to access resources, collaborate and contribute towards learning.
