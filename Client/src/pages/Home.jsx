        <h2>About Radical Unlearning</h2>
      <p>
        We are parents and were students who have experienced the drawbacks of
        mainstream education: too much emphasis on learning measurement, flawed
        measurement techniques, carrot/stick approach, focus on memorisation,
        limited exploration through questioning, intense pressure of competition
        & many more‚Ä¶{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we have created a framework and platform for like-minded people
        mainly unschooling parents and homeschoolers in the learning community
        who would like to support our principles of open, enjoyable and
        effective learning.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework offers essential principles of learning, tools to access
        resources, collaborate and contribute towards learning.
